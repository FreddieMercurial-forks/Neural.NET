# Neural.NET
.NET libarary used to implement and train neural networks using C#

For a full demo, including how to package MNIST data for the network, this repo shows usage of the library: https://github.com/JEMeyer/MNIST-Neural.NET

# Basic usage
To see how to get started with the library, head over to the wiki. There are two articles, [one if you are using the NuGet package,](https://github.com/JEMeyer/Neural.NET/wiki/Using-the-network-(NuGet-Package)) and [one for if you are pulling down the repository and building locally.](https://github.com/JEMeyer/Neural.NET/wiki/Using-the-Network-(Repo-Code))

My goal with this project is to allow neural networks to be more approachable. A lot of the 'matching up' and intricate details that might be annoying to figure out have all been abstracted away. If you have watched a simple tutorial on neural networks and understand how they work at a high level, you should be able to use this libaray. That is my goal, to allow any developer to be able to build their own projects using a neural network with only a basic understanding of how they work. More features will be added with time, so the NuGet package and repo might be out of sync, which is why I have split up the getting started depending on what codebase you are using.

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

Thanks!
